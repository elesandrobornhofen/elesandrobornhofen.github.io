This website has been designed to document my trajectory as an agronomist dedicated to improving crop plants. My journey in agricultural sciences started very early in life, working with my parents on our family farm in Southern Brazil. My curiosity about the ag world led me to enroll in an agricultural and livestock technical program when I was fourteen years old. This was followed by a [B.S. and M.Sc. in Agronomy](http://www.utfpr.edu.br/english), and a [Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Breeding](http://www.en.esalq.usp.br/0). Currently, I am working as a post-doctoral researcher in quantitative genetics and genomics at Aarhus University, Denmark.
