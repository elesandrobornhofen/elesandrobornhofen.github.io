## Working papers

"Soybean tolerance to Asian rust." (*To be submitted*)

This research study aimed to understand the genetic tolerance mechanism of soybean to Asian rust. The motivation lied in the fact that no single control strategy used so far yielded high control rates over time at a reasonable cost. In addition, there is a lack of research studies assessing the potential use of tolerance as a defense strategy against ASR (Asian Soybean Rust).

"Leveraging spatio-temporal genomic prediction in grass breeding."

This research manuscript aims to combine information from multiple environments (spatial) and multiple harvest events (temporal) to maximize predictive ability of dry matter yield and quality traits in ryegrass research.
