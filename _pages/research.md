"Soybean tolerance to Asian rust." (*To be submitted*)

This research study aimed to understand the genetic tolerance mechanism of soybean to Asian rust. The motivation lied in the fact that no single control strategy used so far yielded high control rates over time at a reasonable cost. In addition, there is a lack of research studies assessing the potential use of tolerance as a defense strategy against ASR (Asian Soybean Rust.).
